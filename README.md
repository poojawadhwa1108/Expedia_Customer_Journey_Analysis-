Expedia Customer Analytics Project

This project explores customer behavior on Expedia, focusing on improving service offerings through advanced data analysis. Using a dataset of over 22 million interactions, we apply various customer analytics techniques to provide actionable insights and predictions that can help Expedia tailor its services to different customer segments.

Project Overview

The project aims to leverage customer data to enable Expedia to deliver customized services across the customer lifecycle. We utilize methods like customer segmentation, market basket analysis, and a recommendation system, along with predictive modeling, to analyze hotel bookings and customer interactions.

Data Overview

Source: Expedia (via Kaggle)
Period: January 2013 - January 2015
Scope: 22 million rows and 25 data attributes
Key Attributes: Hotel searches, customer locations, booking behaviors, session attributes
Analytical Techniques

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key trends and patterns in hotel bookings across different periods and regions.
Customer Segmentation: Applied RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer segments.
Market Basket Analysis: Analyzed booking patterns to uncover association rules, though results suggested limited applicability.
Recommendation System: Developed a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to suggest hotels based on implicit customer ratings.
Hotel Booking Prediction: Built an ensemble stacking model achieving 94% accuracy in predicting whether a customer would book a hotel.
Key Findings

The distance between a user's location and the hotel significantly influences booking decisions.
Four distinct customer segments were identified, aiding targeted marketing strategies.
The recommendation system can provide personalized hotel suggestions, enhancing customer retention.
Future Work

Integrating external data sources to decode location-based attributes for richer insights.
Improving model performance with more extensive data and better computational resources.
Extending analysis to longer time frames to strengthen recommendation accuracy.
